<h1>Faded</h1>
You were the shadow to my light<br>
Did you feel us?<br>
Another star, you fade away<br>
Afraid our aim is out of sight<br>
Wanna see us alight<br>

Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Was it all in my fantasy?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Were you only imaginary?<br>

Where are you now?<br>
Atlantis, under the sea<br>
Under the sea<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Another dream<br>
The monster's running wild inside of me<br>
I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>

These shallow waters never met what I needed<br>
I'm letting go, a deeper dive<br>
Eternal silence of the sea<br>
I'm breathing, alive<br>

Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Under the bright but faded lights<br>
You set my heart on fire<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>

Where are you now?<br>
Atlantis, under the sea<br>
Under the sea<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Another dream<br>
The monster's running wild inside of me<br>
I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
I'm faded<br>
So lost, I'm faded<br>
