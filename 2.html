<h1>Shape of you</h1>
The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
So the bar is where I go<br>
Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like<br>
<br>
Girl, you know I want your love<br>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
Although my heart is falling too<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
And last night you were in my room<br>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>

One week in we let the story begin<br>
We're going out on our first date<br>
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
And how your family is doing okay<br>
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br>

Girl, you know I want your love<br>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>

I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
Although my heart is falling too<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
And last night you were in my room<br>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>

Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
